    <p> <br>
        The Tezpur University Computer Society (TUCS) is a student-run organization at Tezpur University that aims to promote the study and understanding of computer science and related fields. TUCS was formed on 17 June 1997 with Prof D K Saikia as the President and Dr R K Das as the Secretary, and Prof K M Pathak, the then Vice Chancellor, as the Advisor. The idea behind TUCS was to create a forum for undertaking co-curricular activities in the field of computer science.


     <br> <br>   Currently, Dr. Debojit Boro is the President of TUCS. The society is open to students, faculty members, and technical personnel of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering and the Computer Center, as well as other interested individuals who can join by paying the membership fees and following the specified procedure.

<br> <br> 
     Throughout its history, TUCS has organized a variety of events and activities for its members. These have included lectures by eminent individuals from academic institutions and the industry, corporate trainings, and events such as quizzes and software contests. In 2002, TUCS started an annual event called CompuBlast, which has been held regularly with breaks in between. CompuBlast 2008 featured an enhanced list of activities.

<br> <br> 
     In addition to these events, TUCS also offers a range of resources and services to its members. Our forum is a place where members can discuss computer science-related topics and ask for advice from their peers. Our blog section is a platform for members to share their thoughts and ideas on current events and trends in the field. Our events calendar keeps members up-to-date on the latest talks, workshops, and conferences happening within the TUCS community. And our project section allows members to showcase their work and find collaborators.

Overall, TUCS is dedicated to fostering a collaborative and inclusive community of learners and innovators who are well-equipped to tackle the challenges of the modern world.
